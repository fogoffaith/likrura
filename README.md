# likrura

**likrura** is a simple Bash script for file encryption and decryption using OpenSSL with AES-256-CBC.  
You will be securely prompted for your password each time you encrypt or decrypt a file—no passwords are stored in environment variables or on disk.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Encrypt any file** with strong AES-256-CBC encryption.
- **Decrypt previously encrypted files**.
- **No password stored:** Prompted interactively each time.
- **Simple CLI usage:** Just type `likrura encrypt <file>` or `likrura decrypt <file.aes>`.
- **Cross-platform:** Works on Linux, macOS, and WSL.
